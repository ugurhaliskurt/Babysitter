## BasicWebDevProject

### Description

This project provides a full-stack web application powered by a **frontend UI**, **backend service**, and a **PostgreSQL database**. The architecture is containerized using Docker, allowing for seamless development and deployment.

The project features:
- A frontend served by **Nginx**.
- A **backend** that supports C++20, Python 3, and PostgreSQL, which can be extended with APIs or other services.
- SSL/TLS using **Caddy** for reverse proxying and certificate management.

### Technologies Used

- **Docker & Docker Compose**
- **Nginx** (for frontend)
- **Caddy** (for reverse proxy and SSL)
- **PostgreSQL** (for database)
- **C++20** (for backend services)
- **Python 3** (for backend services)
- **Flask** (as an example of a Python backend API)

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Docker**: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- **Docker Compose**: [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

---

### Setup and Running the Application

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Build and run the Docker containers**:

   Run the following command to build and start all services (frontend, backend, and database):

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This command will:
   - Start the **Nginx** container serving the frontend.
   - Start the **Caddy** container for reverse proxying and SSL.
   - Start the **backend** container for running C++ and Python services.
   - Start the **PostgreSQL** container for the database.

3. **Access the Frontend**:

   Once the containers are running, you can access the frontend by visiting:

   ```
   http://localhost
   ```

4. **Access the Backend**:

   The backend runs on port `5000` by default (Flask example). You can access the backend API via:

   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

5. **Database Connection**:

   PostgreSQL is set up to run in a container and is available on port `5432`. You can connect to it from the backend using the following credentials:

   - Host: `postgres`
   - Port: `5432`
   - Username: `user`
   - Password: `password`
   - Database: `mydatabase`

---

### How to Use

- **Frontend**: Modify the files in the `public/` directory to change the UI.
- **Backend**:
  - C++ development happens inside the `backend/` folder. You can add new `.cpp` files and compile them inside the container.
  - Python development also happens in the `backend/` folder. You can create new Python scripts and run them within the container.

---

### Example Backend Scripts

1. **C++ Example (`main.cpp`)**:
   - This is a simple C++ program that connects to the PostgreSQL database.

2. **Python Example (`script.py`)**:
   - A Python script that connects to the PostgreSQL database using the `psycopg2` library.

3. **Flask API (`app.py`)**:
   - A basic Flask API that connects to the PostgreSQL database and responds to HTTP requests.

---

### Development Workflow

1. **Modify Frontend**: Change any HTML, CSS, or JS files in the `public/` folder. Your changes will be live immediately when you refresh the browser.

2. **Modify Backend**: Update the C++ or Python files in the `backend/` folder. You can run the C++ programs using `g++` and the Python programs using `python3`.

   To run the Flask API (or other long-running services), they will automatically start when you bring up the containers.

---

### Future Improvements

- Add authentication and user management.
- Expand the backend to support more APIs or services.
- Add frontend framework (e.g., React or Vue.js).
- Implement unit tests for backend services.
